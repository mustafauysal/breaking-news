Easy way to announce "Breaking News" on your WordPress site. 

## Description ##
This plugin appends "[Breaking News]" to your post title for a selected time range. That's all!


### Why? ###
When you want to announce "breaking news" on your WordPress sites, generally adding "[Breaking ...]" expression to post title than a few hours later you need to update again. 
That's ok, but generally you forgot to update permalink and this is our first problem. 

**Second, permalinks should be permanent!**
This is good for SEO and social sharing.
